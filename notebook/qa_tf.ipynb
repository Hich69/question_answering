Prior to this position , García Padilla held various roles in the political landscape of Puerto Rico ; first as Secretary of Consumer Affairs , and then as a member of the 24th Senate of Puerto Rico and as president of the Popular Democratic Party .

Regardless of this , he was not able to persuade several members of his own party to support his proposals .
